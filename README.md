# The Trophic Analysis Toolbox
***Analysing flow hierarchies and structure in complex directed networks***

The Trophic Analysis Toolbox is an easy to use open [*Matlab*](https://github.com/BazilSansom/Trophic-Analysis-Toolbox/tree/master/Matlab_files) and [*Python*](https://github.com/BazilSansom/Trophic-Analysis-Toolbox/tree/master/Python_files) toolbox that implements methods for the analysis and visualisation of flow structure in directed networks using *trophic levels* and *trophic coherence* [[1](https://doi.org/10.1098/rsos.201138)], [[2](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1409077111)], as well as other related methods and performs a wide variety of operations on directed graphs.

These methods are relevant for anybody studying systems that can be represented as directed networks. Some areas of clear relevance include: economics and finance; ecology; neuroscience; genetics and biochemistry; and social networks. We hope the tools we make available can support their use in a variety of applications and attempt to organise the toolbox with this wide audience in mind.

*At this stage we are still in the process of migrating the toolbox to this repository: we will thus add capability quite rapidly then continue to expand and improve over time.*
