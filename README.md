# The Trophic Analysis Toolbox
***Analysing flow hierarchies and structure in complex directed networks***

The Trophic Analysis Toolbox is an easy to use open [*Matlab*](https://github.com/BazilSansom/How-directed-is-a-directed-network/tree/master/Matlab_files) and [*Python*](https://github.com/BazilSansom/How-directed-is-a-directed-network/tree/master/Python_files) toolbox that implements methods for the analysis and visualisation of flow structure in directed networks using *trophic levels* and *trophic coherence* (1, 2), as well as other related methods and performs a wide variety of operations on directed graphs.

These methods are relevant for anybody studying systems that can be represented as directed networks. Some areas of clear relevance include: economics and finance; ecology; neuroscience; genetics and biochemistry; and social networks. We hope the tools we make available can support their use in a variety of applications and attempt to organise the toolbox with this wide audience in mind.

*At this stage we are still in the process of migrating the toolbox to this repository: we will thus add capability quite rapidly then continue to expand and improve over time.*

This toolbox was written by:
- Bazil Sansom (*University of Warwick*)
- Samuel Johnson (*University of Birmingham*)
- Jose Moran (*University of Oxford*)
