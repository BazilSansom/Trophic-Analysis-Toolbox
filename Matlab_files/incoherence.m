function [h,F0] = incoherence(W,varargin)

% This function calculates generalised heights and incoherence 
%  statistics as introduced in ref [1] for any weakly connected directed
%  network.

% INPUTS:
% Required
% W      adjacency matrix for directed graph (may be weighted or unweighted
%        and can include self-loops. Allows at most one edge from a node 
%        m to a node n (function assumes no multi-edges but might check for 
%        this and amalgamate in future)). This graph should be weakly connected
%        (in the sense that it would be connected if undirected).
% Optional:
% 'h0'  (optional) allows specification of how to set zero height. Default is to set
%       height of lowest node h=0; can also specify 'h0', 'wm' in order to
%       set the (weighted) degree weighted mean level to zero; or 'sm' to
%       centre around simple mean. Fmin is invarient to any shift by an
%       arbitrary constant, but this choice of zero level may be relevant
%       for some comparisons, or presentational issues when it comes to
%       heights.
%
% Outputs:
% - h    This is vector of heights for each node in W obtained based on 
%        improved notion of trophic level introduced by [1] (solution to (Eq.6)).
%        Standardised around some zero level (defined by 'h0' or default by
%        which lowest node has level zero). These heights minimize 
%        cost function ('trophic confusion') F(h) Eq.8 [1].
% - F0   This is the cost function F(h) (Eq.8 [1]) evaluated at h. This is
%        our measure of incoherence. F0 = 0 iff all the level differences 
%        zmn = hn âˆ’ hm are 1; and F0 = 1 iff all the level differences are 0.
%        Trophic coherence is thus defined as 1-F0.
% - eta  the ratio of the edge-weighted mean height difference (which
%        evaluates to 1-F0) over the standard deviatio of the height
%        differences, which evaluates to sqrt(F0/(1-F0)). ([1] Eq.16).
