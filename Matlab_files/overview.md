- **Examples** provides some examples that illustrate methods/test functions running.

**Core functions:**
- **incoherence**   returns *trophic levels* (provides a wrapper for *levels*) and *trophic incoherence* statistics as per [1]
- **levels**        returns *trophic levels* as per [1]

**Digraph opperations:**
- **adj2edgelist**  converts adjacency matrix to edgelist
- **edge_diff**     takes diferences over each edge (i->j or j->i) for vector of node values

**Auxiliary functions:**
- **parseArgs**    is a borrowed function that use extensively to allow optional inputs in many functions.
